## Node.js Version

This project is developed and tested to work with Node.js version >= 18.17.0 and <= 21.7.0.

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). It's recommended to use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily switch between Node.js versions.

Once Node.js is installed, you can proceed with the project installation by following the steps in the [Installation](#installation) section.

## Getting Started

When running a Next.js project for the first time, the initial build process may take some time. It's recommended to perform the build separately before running the project for a smoother experience. You can use the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
# or
bun build
```

After the initial build, you can start the project using the following commands:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
# or
bun start
```

you can use the regular development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Installation

   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Features

- Interactive filters and data table.
- Add, edit, and delete student data with ease.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Built with Material-UI

- This project exclusively utilizes [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) for building the user interface.
- Material-UI provides a set of React components that follow the Material Design guidelines, making it easy to create sleek and responsive UIs.
- By leveraging Material-UI, we ensure a consistent and visually appealing design throughout the application.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- `app`: Contains the main components for rendering pages and the primary navigation logic.
- `components`: Reusable React components used throughout the project.
- `utils`: Global utility functions and components, such as the date picker.
- `models`: Backend models for database schema and data handling.
- `lib`: Houses slices, custom hooks, and the Redux store configuration.

## Technologies

> Frontend: Next.js
> Testing: Jest for testing

## Additional Information

- The result of `npm outdated` is null, indicating that all dependencies are up-to-date.
- `depcheck` reported two unused dependencies, `jest-enviornment-jsdom` and `typescript`. It's important to note that `jest-enviornment-jsdom` is essential for testing, providing a browser-like environment using jsdom. Jest itself doesn't include a full browser environment by default, and for testing React applications, a DOM (Document Object Model) environment is often necessary to simulate interactions with the browser.
- `typescript` is automatically installed when creating a project in TypeScript.

### Note on MuiDataGrid Filters

In the project, the MuiDataGrid component has been utilized, offering a streamlined interface for displaying tabular data. It's noteworthy that the standard MuiDataGrid provides a single filter at a time.
If a more feature-rich filtering experience is desired, including multiple filters simultaneously, consider exploring the premium features available in the MUI DataGridPremium plan.
